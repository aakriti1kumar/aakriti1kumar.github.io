In this [paper](trust_paper.pdf), I review work on human-machine interaction with a focus on understanding how and when humans trust machines. I use the terms machine, AI, algorithm, and decision aid interchangeably to describe a black-box model. The paper is organized as follows. I briefly review the different ways trust is defined across fields. I then review some popular models of trust between humans. Next, I move to a discussion of trust between humans, the different factors that affect human trust in machines, and some models of trust between humans and machines. I conclude with some thoughts on the possible research directions.
