I keep track of the books I read using [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36976329-aakriti-kumar).
This year I've set myself a challenge of reading [36 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/31518884). 
Here are my past challenges: 
[2021: 21 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/2594617)
[2020: 25 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/19526861)
[2019: 25 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/18225877)


I occasionally post [videos](https://www.instagram.com/aakritikumarmusic/?hl=en) of myself signing and strumming my ukelele. 

I also like to keep a tab on academic [twitter](https://twitter.com/aakriti1kumar).
