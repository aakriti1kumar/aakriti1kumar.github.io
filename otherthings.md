I use [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36976329-aakriti-kumar) to keep track of the books I read.
This year I've set a goal of reading [36 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/31518884).

Here's my reading list from the last few years: 
  - [2021: 21 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/2594617)
  - [2020: 25 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/19526861)
  - [2019: 25 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/18225877)

I occasionally post [videos](https://www.instagram.com/aakritikumarmusic/?hl=en) of myself signing and strumming my ukelele.
