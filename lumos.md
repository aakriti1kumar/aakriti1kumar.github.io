Practice in real-world settings exhibits many idiosyncracies of scheduling and duration 
that can only roughly approximated by laboratory research. In this paper, we investigate 39,157 
individualsâ€™ performance on two cognitive games on the Lumosity platform over a span of 
five years. The large-scale nature of the data allows us to observe highly varied lengths of 
uncontrolled interruptions to practice and offers a unique view of learning in naturalistic 
settings.
