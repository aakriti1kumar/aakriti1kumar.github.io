## Bio

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Kellogg School of Management](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/) and the [Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems (NICO)](https://www.nico.northwestern.edu/), where I work with [Dr. Matt Groh](https://mattgroh.com/). 

My research examines how AI is reshaping the way people work and learn. Through large-scale behavioral experiments combined with computational and qualitative analysis, I pursue three interconnected goals: <br> (1) developing rigorous evaluation frameworks to assess when humans and AI form effective partnerships, <br> (2) designing interactions that support rather than atrophy human metacognition and skill development, and <br>
(3) understanding when and how AI can serve as a helpful companion and foster better human-human connection. 

I earned my PhD in Cognitive Science from the University of California, Irvine, where I was advised by [Dr. Mark Steyvers](https://steyvers.socsci.uci.edu/). I also hold a Master's degree in Statistics from UCI and got my B.Tech. in Materials Engineering from IIT Madras, India. 

You can find my [CV](CV.pdf) here and my publications on [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XFM1ItgAAAAJ&hl=en). 

Feel free to reach out to me for collaborations or any inquiries related to my research!
