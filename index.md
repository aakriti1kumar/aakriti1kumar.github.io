## Bio

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Kellogg School of Management](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/) and the [Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems (NICO)](https://www.nico.northwestern.edu/), where I work with [Dr. Matt Groh](https://mattgroh.com/) on developing AI tools to help humans build skills in empathic communication and synthetic media detection. 

My research examines how AI is reshaping the way people work, learn, and navigate life. Through large-scale behavioral experiments combined with computational and qualitative analysis, I pursue three interconnected goals: developing rigorous evaluation frameworks to assess when humans and AI form effective partnerships; designing interactions that support rather than atrophy human metacognition and skill development; and understanding when and how AI can serve as a helpful companion and foster better human-human connection. My work blends insights from cognitive science, human-computer interaction, and machine learning to understand the principles underlying productive human-AI collaboration.

I earned my PhD in Cognitive Science from the University of California, Irvine, where I was advised by [Dr. Mark Steyvers](https://steyvers.socsci.uci.edu/). I also hold a Master's degree in Statistics from UCI and got my B.Tech. in Materials Engineering from IIT Madras, India. 

You can find my [CV](CV.pdf) here and my publications on [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XFM1ItgAAAAJ&hl=en).
