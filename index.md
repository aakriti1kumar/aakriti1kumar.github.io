## Bio

I earned my PhD in Cognitive Science from the University of California, Irvine, where I was advised by [Dr. Mark Steyvers](https://steyvers.socsci.uci.edu/). My interests lie at the intersection of cognitive science and human-computer interaction. I obtain insight into humans' mental models of AI by designing robust behavioral experiments and developing computational cognitive models.  

I spent most of 2023 as a Human-Computer Interaction Intern at [Motional](https://motional.com/), where I was advised by [Dr. Krysta Chauncey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/krysta-chauncey). Together with an amazing team of ML researchers, UX researchers, and product managers, we work on improving customers' experience with Motional's RoboTaxi. I also spent the summer of 2022 interning at [Honda Research Institute](https://usa.honda-ri.com/), where I was hosted by [Dr. Kumar Akash](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=03uSPzAAAAAJ&hl=en). 

I hold a Master's degree in Statistics from UCI. Before coming to UCI, I got my B.Tech. in Engineering from IIT Madras, India. My research experience in academic and industry settings has motivated me to bridge the gap between theoretical research and practical applications. I bring a unique interdisciplinary skill-set, making me well-suited to undertake research at the intersection of social science and artificial intelligence. 

Feel free to reach out to me for collaborations or any inquiries related to my research!
